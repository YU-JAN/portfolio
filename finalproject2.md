## User research and interviews

### User research(Testing) protocol

#### Research goal:
- To discover some issues (blind-spots) within the wireframe
- To guage readers' general feelings after reading through the story
- To understand general readers' expereince in using ridehailing apps 

#### Target test participants: 
I plan to invite 3 test participants. I would like to reach out to people who have rideshare experience so that they will feel more relatable, and it might be easier for them to find out some detailed issues within the wireframe. I also intended to reach out to some visual designers for feedback because they might give more valuable suggestions in terms of visual representations.


#### Interview script:
##### Opening
Welcome, it’s nice to meet you and thank you for being here, I will be the one conducting this interview with you. As we mentioned, I am working on a final data visualization project for a class, and today, I would like to show you my wireframe, and ask for your thoughts, impressions, and feedback. Please be honest! All of these are just ideas meant to generate more ideas, so feel free to be “mean” about the wireframe. The more honest feedback I get right now, in the early stages of the work, the better the outcome will be for the project. Do you have any questions?

##### Higer level questions

So I am going to ask some background questions just to note for reference.
- Can you tell me about yourself?
- Have you ever used any ride-hailing app like Uber or Lyft?

##### Wireframe Section

Ok, Now, I would like to share the wireframe with you.(showing the wireframe), please feel free to navigate the wireframe on your own. I encourage you to think a loud, because I would be able to know how you think about the story.

After test participants read through the wireframe
<br>
Now I would like to ask you a few questions.
- What do you feel about the visual story in general?
- Please tell me what do you learn from this story?
- What do you think about the data visualization?
- What will you do after reading this landing page?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Do you have any questions or concerns about the story?

##### Wrap-up Questions
- Thank you for today's interview, do you have anything you want to share with me?
- Do you recommend me talk to anyone else and can you make that connection?


#### Testing Notes

##### Test participant 1
- The section separators were not clear
- There was no summary to connect everything, so a little bit overwhelming (you don't have a connection between the story and Andrea) --> Summary needs to be more visible, connect back to Andrea, and make sure if readers follow.
- The lack of visual data (it's more just text, did not see too many graphics)
- The visual representation could be more creative/illustrative
- The sexual harassment section does not have visual, maybe need more data points on that.
- I should have more objective reasoning behind why
-  (action) Not be an uber driver, but I will probably read the recommended action and verify the source.
-  What is the intention of the story. I think this study should motivate more people to conduct more studies and urge Uber/Lyft to show more datasets.

##### Test participant 2
- The color palette for different charts needs to be consistent.
- Some chart labels are missing, which causes more confusion while reading the chart. Please make sure all charts have labels on the x and y-axis.
- Detailed feedback on weekly earning comparison: In your paragraph, you said the income gap is 7%, while looking at the chart I feel the gap is more than 7%

#### Test participant 3
- The transition from the background information to Andrea's story is not smooth.
- There is a Chinese character on the Tableau map. You can change the language setting.
- Summary section is needed. It does not need to be one more paragraph, maybe one sentence is good.
- The visual does not look eye-catching. Consider adding different types of charts. 
- My call to action is to read more articles and news before taking any further action like signing a petition.

#### Summary of Testing Result
- The color palette needs to rearrange and match the presentation.
- Should have a summary in each paragraph to help readers recap and summarize the important parts.
- Customize the call to action to different user groups.


## Moodboard

I would like to create a color scheme that is soft and calm to convey the topic of female uber drivers. Here is my mood board.
