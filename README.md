# About me

<img src="profile.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>


I am a product designer currently pursuing the Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services(UX Design) degree at Carnegie Mellon University where I explore new UX methods, conduct HCI research ( interactive voice technologies@Coala Lab, game design @eHeart Lab )

I love to design for technology, healthcare, and gender issues, and I am especially into topics regarding ethical AI. In my fellowship project at CMU, I collaborated with the US Census Bureau to prototype an Anti-bias toolkit for governmental agencies.

With my 3+ years in tech and media start-ups in Taiwan, I excel at improving user experience for digital products. I also designed logos and Web UI for freelance projects while I have spare time.

I strive to create products and services accessible to different user groups so that each person can have an equal, fair, and uplifting user experience.
