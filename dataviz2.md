## General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Trend in OCED countries
<br>
This is a grid of line charts for General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio, and we are able to see General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Trends in different countries. The x-axis represents "year", ranged from 1995 to 2019, and the y-axis stands for Debt-to-GDP Ratio.

## Debt-to-GDP Ratio for Japan and Greece from 1995 to 2019
<br>
I created a Hans Rosling chart from the same dataset. Hans Rosling charts are plotted to help readers see the changes Japan and Greece made from 1995 to 2019. Please click the "play" button to view the variation. The size of the dots also represents the value of the Debt-to-GDP Ratio. By doing so, readers can notice the changes more easily.
