# High Level Project Summary:

###"Same work, different pay? Here is the Gender Income Gap"
Gender income gap has been a known issue for decades. Despite the technological advancedment, this inequality seems to remain the same. Therefore, in the final report, I intend to explore gender wage gap, and how we could potentially help with the issue. I would also like to apply the data visualization methodologies I learned in Telling Stories with Data class to the topic. 

# Part I

## Outline

Learned from the Good Charts book, I would like to incorporate "tell stories," "create tension" and "setup-conflict-resolution" model for my topic.

## The data

For the final report, I have identified some datasets that might be useful:
1. Gender Wage Gap from OCED:  [Clich here](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/)
The dataset includes the wage gap ratio among 39 OCED countries in 20 years. In this dataset, I intend to compare the income inequality across different countries. 
2. Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey [Clich here](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm)
In this dataset, I would like to further compare the weekly earning among men and women in different occupations, and I especially want to look into the wage gap in the tech industry.
