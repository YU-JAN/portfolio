## High Level Project Summary:

### "Hey I am Andrea, and I am a female Uber driver." 

I got to talk with some uber and Lyft drivers before and learned about many challenges rideshare drivers might encounter, such as safety and benefits. While reading posts from a Facebook ground called ["Women Uber Drivers & Women Lyft Drivers"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1065540300147658) I was impressed by many unreasonable issues that happened around female drivers. My intention for this final presentation is to tell a story and draw everyone's attention to this minority gig worker group.

//Note: I changed the topic in phase two; the original one was the gender income gap. Instead of making an effort on a generic and well-known topic (which is also essential), I decided to go with a more specific case with some income gap data to support my story. 

# Part I

## Outline

Learned from the Good Charts book, I would like to incorporate "tell stories," "create tension" and "setup-conflict-resolution" model for my topic.
<br>
üìçSetup:
<br>
Start with a story: Jenny graduated from Carnegie Mellon University 3 years ago, she's currently working in Pittsburgh for a self-driving company.
<br>
üìçConflict:
<br>
Story: One day, Jenny found out that her salary is lower than all of her male colleagues.
<br>
Chart: showing the income wage difference, across countries(Ideally, this chart will be a map) and within the US(Ideally, this chart will be a map). Then move on to another chart, highlight the wage inequality in tech industries.
<br>
üìçResolution:
<br>
Chart: showing the inequality line by years, and ideally the chart shows the gender income gap is decreasing. 
<br>
Call to action: In this section, I would like to share some relevant articles, which help readers who want to dive deep into these topics. I will also share some websites that call out gender equality.

## The data

For the final report, I have identified some datasets that might be useful:
1. Gender Wage Gap from OCED:  [Click here](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/)<br>
The dataset includes the wage gap ratio among 39 OCED countries in 20 years. In this dataset, I intend to compare the income inequality across different countries.

## Method and medium

I plan to use shorthand or Wix as the story medium, and I will illustrate some figures on Illustration and Photoshop to add more visual elements to the story. I'll also look up some free photo stock like Unsplash for my story scenarios. As for data analysis, I plan to use Excel, or SQL for data cleaning and dealing with missing data. The major data visualization tool for the assignment will be Tableau and Flourish.
