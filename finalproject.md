## High Level Project Summary:

### "Hey I am Andrea, and I am a female Uber driver." 

I got to talk with some uber and Lyft drivers before and learned about many challenges rideshare drivers might encounter, such as safety and benefits. While reading posts from a Facebook ground called ["Women Uber Drivers & Women Lyft Drivers"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1065540300147658) I was impressed by many unreasonable issues that happened around female drivers. My intention for this final presentation is to tell a story and draw everyone's attention to this minority gig worker group.

//Note: I changed the topic in phase two; the original one was the gender income gap. Instead of making an effort on a generic and well-known topic (which is also essential), I decided to go with a more specific case with some income gap data to support my story. 

# Part I

## Outline

Learned from the Good Charts book, I would like to incorporate "tell stories," "create tension" and "setup-conflict-resolution" model for my topic.
<br>
üìçSetup:
<br>
Start with a story: Jenny graduated from Carnegie Mellon University 3 years ago, she's currently working in Pittsburgh for a self-driving company.
<br>
üìçConflict:
<br>
Story: One day, Jenny found out that her salary is lower than all of her male colleagues.
<br>
Chart: showing the income wage difference, across countries(Ideally, this chart will be a map) and within the US(Ideally, this chart will be a map). Then move on to another chart, highlight the wage inequality in tech industries.
<br>
üìçResolution:
<br>
Chart: showing the inequality line by years, and ideally the chart shows the gender income gap is decreasing. 
<br>
Call to action: In this section, I would like to share some relevant articles, which help readers who want to dive deep into these topics. I will also share some websites that call out gender equality.

## The data

For the final report, I have identified some datasets that might be useful:
1. Gender Wage Gap from OCED:  [Click here](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/)<br>
The dataset includes the wage gap ratio among 39 OCED countries in 20 years. In this dataset, I intend to compare the income inequality across different countries. 
2. Male Uber Drivers Outearn Their Female Counterparts [Click here](https://www-statista-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/chart/14660/male-uber-drivers-outearn-their-female-counterparts/)
3. Sex Of Drivers Involved In Fatal Crashes, 2010-2019 [Click here](https://www.iii.org/table-archive/20749)
4. Gig Worker Carjackings [Click here](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-gig-carjacking)

## Method and medium

I plan to use shorthand or Wix as the story medium, and I will illustrate some figures on Illustration and Photoshop to add more visual elements to the story. I'll also look up some free photo stock like Unsplash for my story scenarios. As for data analysis, I plan to use Excel, or SQL for data cleaning and dealing with missing data. The major data visualization tool for the assignment will be Tableau and Flourish.


# Part II

## Storyboard and wireframes

## User research and interviews

### User research(Testing) protocol

#### Research goal:
- To discover some issues (blind-spots) within the wireframe
- To guage readers' general feelings after reading through the story
- To understand general readers' expereince in using ridehailing apps 

#### Target test participants: 
I plan to invite 3 test participants. I would like to reach out to people who have rideshare experience so that they will feel more relatable, and it might be easier for them to find out some detailed issues within the wireframe. I also intended to reach out to some visual designers for feedback because they might give more valuable suggestions in terms of visual representations.


#### Interview script:
Opening
<br>
Welcome, it‚Äôs nice to meet you and thank you for being here, I will be the one conducting this interview with you. As we mentioned, I am working on a final data visualization project for a class, and today, I would like to show you my wireframe, and ask for your thoughts, impressions, and feedback. Please be honest! All of these are just ideas meant to generate more ideas, so feel free to be ‚Äúmean‚Äù about the wireframe. The more honest feedback I get right now, in the early stages of the work, the better the outcome will be for the project. Do you have any questions?
<br>
Higer level questions
<br>
So I am going to ask some background questions just to note for reference.
- Can you tell me about yourself?
- Have you ever used any ride-hailing app like Uber or Lyft?
<br>
wireframe Section
<br>
Ok, Now, I would like to share the wireframe with you.(showing the wireframe), please feel free to navigate the wireframe on your own. I encourage you to think a loud, because I would be able to know how you think about the story.
<br>
After test participants read through the wireframe
<br>
Now I would like to ask you a few questions.
- What do you feel about the visual story in general?
- Please tell me what do you learn from this story?
- What do you think about the data visualization?
- What will you do after reading this landing page?
- Do you have any questions or concerns about the story?
<br>
Wrap-up Questions
- Thank you for today's interview, do you have anything you want to share with me?
- Do you recommend me talk to anyone else and can you make that connection?
