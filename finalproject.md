## High Level Project Summary:

### "Hey I am Andrea, and I am a female Uber driver." 

The final project is aimed to draw people's attention to an invisible topic - female Uber drivers and the difficulties they encounter. In the report, several data visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, and maps, are made to better convey the information.

<br>
I got to talk with some uber and Lyft drivers before and learned about many challenges rideshare drivers might encounter, such as safety and benefits. While reading posts from a Facebook ground called ["Women Uber Drivers & Women Lyft Drivers"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1065540300147658) I was surprised by many unreasonable issues that happened around female drivers. My intention for this final presentation is to tell a story and draw everyone's attention to this minority gig worker group, and potentially invite everyone to make some changes.

//Note: I changed the topic in the phase 2; the original one was the gender income gap. Instead of making an effort on a generic and well-known topic (which is also essential), I decided to go with a more specific case with some income gap data to support my story. 

# Part I

## Outline

Learned from the Good Charts book, I would like to incorporate "tell stories," "create tension" and "setup-conflict-resolution" model for my topic.
<br>
#### üìçSetup:
Start with background information: I would like to start by sharing what the "gig economy" is and why it is so popular now, and then introduce Uber, as a rideshare company, about how it grows in recent years. After that, I will show a driver sex ratio, and lead the audience to the topic. Starting from a female uber driver's story.
#### üìçConflict:
Story: Andrea is a single mom, she found out that driving cars for Uber might be a good business when she has spare time. However, she barely notices that being a female uber driver, there are a lot of challenges awaiting her. Starting from income inequality, a study from Standford shows that man has more hourly wage than women. Looking into mobility safety, being a uber drive put Andrea at a high risk of carjacking. Uber and Lyft didn‚Äôt respond to requests to provide data on the number of carjackings involving their drivers. Other things like sexual harassment etc.  
#### üìçResolution and call to action:
What we could do? Let's look at how governments and organizations have done: (1) Seattle City Council votes to take a closer look at ride-hailing services (2) There are many female uber/Lyft drivers' guilds on Facebook. I would also like to share some relevant articles that readers can further dive into, some petitions that might be related to the topic so that readers can take an action if they want to support female uber drivers.

## The data

For the final report, I have identified some datasets that might be useful:
1. Gender Wage Gap from OCED:  [Click here](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/)<br>
The dataset includes the wage gap ratio among 39 OCED countries in 20 years. In this dataset, I intend to compare the income inequality across different countries. 
2. Male Uber Drivers Outearn Their Female Counterparts [Click here](https://www-statista-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/chart/14660/male-uber-drivers-outearn-their-female-counterparts/)

## Method and medium

I plan to use Wix as the story medium, and I will illustrate some figures on Illustration and Photoshop to add more visual elements to the story. I'll also look up some free photo stocks like Unsplash for my story scenarios. As for data analysis, I plan to use Excel, or SQL for data cleaning and dealing with missing data. The major data visualization tool for the assignment will be Tableau and Flourish.
