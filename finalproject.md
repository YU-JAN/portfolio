# High Level Project Summary:

### "Same work, different pay? Here is the Gender Income Gap"
Gender income gap has been a known issue for decades. Despite the technological advancedment, this inequality seems to remain the same. Therefore, in the final report, I intend to explore gender wage gap, and how we could potentially help with the issue. I would also like to apply the data visualization methodologies I learned in Telling Stories with Data class to the topic. 

# Part I

## Outline

Learned from the Good Charts book, I would like to incorporate "tell stories," "create tension" and "setup-conflict-resolution" model for my topic.
<br>
üìçSetup:
<br>
Start with a story: Jenny graduated from Carnegie Mellon University 3 years ago, she's currently working in Pittsburgh for a self-driving company.
<br>
üìçConflict:
<br>
Story: One day, Jenny found out that her salary is lower than all of her male colleagues.
<br>
Chart: showing the income wage difference, across countries(Ideally, this chart will be a map) and within the US(Ideally, this chart will be a map). Then move on to another chart, highlight the wage inequality in tech industries.
<br>
üìçResolution:
<br>
Chart: showing the inequality line by years, and ideally the chart shows the gender income gap is decreasing. 
<br>
Call to action: In this section, I would like to share some relevant articles, which help readers who want to dive deep into these topics. I will also share some websites that call out gender equality.

## The data

For the final report, I have identified some datasets that might be useful:
1. Gender Wage Gap from OCED:  [Click here](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/)<br>
The dataset includes the wage gap ratio among 39 OCED countries in 20 years. In this dataset, I intend to compare the income inequality across different countries. 
2. Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey [Click here](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm)<br>
In this dataset, I would like to further compare the weekly earning among men and women in different occupations, and I especially want to look into the wage gap in the tech industry.
3. Pittsburgh American Community Survey 2015 - Miscellaneous Data [Click here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data)<br>
In this dataset, I would like to specifically show the gender income difference in Pittsburgh.


## Method and medium

I plan to use shorthand or Wix as the story medium, and I will illustrate some figures on Illustration and Photoshop to add more visual elements to the story. I'll also look up some free photo stock like Unsplash for my story scenarios. As for data analysis, I plan to use Excel, or SQL for data cleaning and dealing with missing data. The major data visualization tool for the assignment will be Tableau and Flourish.
