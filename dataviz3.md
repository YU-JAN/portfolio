# Critique the data visualization

## Step1. find a data visualization 

I found this chart from a post in Reddit's sub-discussion board "dataisbeautiful". The data visualization is made from a paper publised in 2006, called [Trajectories and Constraints in Brain Evolution in Primates and Cetaceans](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11598-006-9027-4) where the researcher was investigated the brain sizes in different species.

## Step2. critique the visualization

The critique is followed byStephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile.

### Overall Observations

I was initially intrigued by the appealing title: brain size and brain weight, 

### primary audience?
I can't be sure who the target audiences are, but since the graphic was posted on Reddit, I assume the intended reader would be people who like data visualization. This post got 3.7k likes with 290 comments, so I believe the DataViz is quite successful in terms of catching people's eyes.

### Final thoughts: 
I really likeStephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness method, and I personally think this is more like a usability heuristic evaluation 


## Step3. wireframe a solution



## Step4. test the solution

## Step5. build my solution
