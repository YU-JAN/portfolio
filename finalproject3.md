## Design Decisions for Final Deliverable
<br>

### 1. Make sure all of visualizations are informative:
Since many comments I received were focused on the clarity of the charts and some missing axis labels, I especially double-checked on all charts before the submission to make sure the visuals are clear and correct. On the other hand, I used "iframe" code to embed the charts to my website and deleted the logo credit, so that entire charts are clean, and readers will not get distracted easily (I put the credits to the reference section instead)

### 2. Remove unnecessary content:
While finalizing the content and design, I realized I do not have to share all of the information I found in the story, and the more information on the site, the easier people will lose interest. So compared to the prototype in (phase 2)[https://preview.shorthand.com/4BtDcbYiMgXKWjfQ], I removed the earth to mars graphics because it is just a metaphor to help the reader imagine 20 billion trips. I also streamlined the content by omitting too wordy descriptions.

### 3. Add more hand-drawings:
Since I really wanna the visuals to be like some data stories from new york times with strong graphics, I did not attached any photos in the story. The challenging part is I want to draw figures and some charts myself, but I did not have that much time. So I went ot Freepik to find some relavant illustrations. However, while implementing those sketches, I, again, realized that

###  4. Font size:
I chose to make the font size bigger than a normal website's standard because I imagine that people might not be able to read clearly in the screen in the classroom. I set the Header 1 font size as 100 px, header 2 font size as 50 px, and paragraph font size as 20 px.
<br>

###  5. Animation
While placing all components into the landing page, I noticed that it's important to create some micro-animations to help catch users' eyes.

### Peer Group Feedback

### identified audience 

My intended audiences are all people who are able to access Internet, who are interested in ride-hailing services.
 
## Presentation Preparation

Since the presentation is 1 minute pitch, and I will not be able to share everything in the landing page, I initially picked up some most important metrics that I want to share.
