## Design Decisions for Final Deliverable
<br>

### 1. Make sure all of visualizations are informative:
Since many comments I received were focused on the clarity of the charts and some missing axis labels, I especially double-checked on all charts before the submission to make sure the visuals are clear and correct. On the other hand, I used "iframe" code to embed the charts to my website and deleted the logo credit, so that entire charts are clean, and readers will not get distracted easily (I put the credits to the reference section instead)
<br>
### 2. Remove unnecessary content:
While finalizing the content and design, reviewers in class suggested I do not have to share all of the information in the story, and the more information on the site, the easier people will lose interest. So compared to the prototype in [phase 2](https://preview.shorthand.com/4BtDcbYiMgXKWjfQ), I removed the earth to mars graphics because it is just a metaphor to help readers imagine the length of 20 billion trips. I also streamlined the content by omitting too wordy descriptions in each paragraph.
<br>
### 3. Add more hand-drawings:
I spent some time experimenting with graphic style on this landing page. First, I wanted a visual story like some data stories from New York Times with decent graphics, so I did not add any photos on the page. However, I realized that I did not have that much time to flesh out all the illustrations myself, and decided to pick some relevant stock illustrations from Freepik. While implementing those sketches, I found that those illustrations were different and incompatible with my illustration. Eventually, I removed those pictures from Freepik, which might create some white space on the page, but more in united components. ( Apart from icons, all other illustrations are my work!)
<br>

###  4. Font size:
After a few rounds of experiments, I decided to make the font size bigger than the general website's standard because I imagine that my audiences might not be able to read clearly on the screen in the classroom. I set the font size of Header 1 as 100 px, header 2 as 50 px, and paragraph font size as 20 px.
<br>

###  5. Animation
While placing all components on the landing page, I noticed that adding some micro-animations can help catch users' eyes. I know that shorthand does a good job of automatically adding animations to the modules. But since I created the site with Wix, I need to assign an animation to each component individually. 

## Identified Audience 

My intended audiences are people who are able to access the Internet, who are interested in ride-hailing services, and people who can read in English. But if it's possible, I also want to draw big corporations' eyes (such as the platform service Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Grubhub, and so on) to the specific group - Female rideshare drivers.


## Presentation Preparation

To prepare for the 1-minute pitch, I tried multiple forms with different content. I really want to talk about the background of the gig economy in the beginning before diving into Andrea's story. However, I was unable to control the time in 1 minute with all of the content. So I decided to focus on "Andrea's story" for my opening, and challenges next. It's an interesting experience to practice condense my speech into 1 minute, and also see other classmate's presentation (was impressed by the business pitch, it is really cool!) I believe this presentation practice will be helpful for my future elevator pitch too!
